Correct settings of the HM11 module
They should be configured through serial monitor before deployment
AT+BAUD3  57600
AT+MODE2  Remote control + transmit
AT+NOTI1  Notify arduino on connect/disconnect
AT+NAMESheild set correct name
AT+PIO11  Set LED mode to not blink when not connected
AT+PWRM0  Set auto sleep mode. Auto sleep means it will be in sleep mode before phone is connected. After phone is connected, automatically out of sleep mode and can receive AT commands. When you are sending commands through serial monitor, you need to manually wake it up first by sending a long string, length>80. It will respond with AT+WAKE

Commands that are sent from the phone after establishing a connection

AT smoke test. returns OK
AT+PIO2[par] Command to remote control PIO2 (turn arduino on or off)

Workflow comments

When our HM11 is in mode 2 (remote control + transmit) it can always receive AT commands. In disconnected state from Arduino, in connected state from the phone. If an AT command is sent, arduino will respond back to the sender with result, if something else is sent, it will transmit.

// Pasha is testing commands
1. Smoke test: AT
in disconnected state:  -> OK
in connected state: disconnects

2.Connection notification status: AT+NOTI
If this value is set to 1, when link ESTABLISHED or LOSTED module will send OK+CONN or OK+LOST string through UART.

3. 



2. Firmware version
AT+VERR? -> AnyFlite V528

3. module address
AT+ADDR? -> OK+ADDR:B4994C572F6C

4.Query/Set PIO1 output status (System LED)
AT+PIO1? -> OK+Get:1 (1 is Unconnected outputLow, Connected outputHigh, 0 is Unconnected Output500ms High 500ms Low,Connected output High)

5. Query/Set Module Work Mode
we need 1
AT+MODE? -> OK+Get:1
